# Avneesh Chaudhary's Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio website, where I showcase my engineering projects and professional achievements. Built using the Astro framework and integrated with Keystatic CMS, this site leverages modern web technologies to ensure a seamless user experience and efficient content management.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This portfolio utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **Astro**: A modern framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
- **Keystatic CMS**: A simple and scalable content management system tailored for static sites.
- **Vercel**: For hosting and automating deployments, providing edge functions for dynamic capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Employed for adding type safety to JavaScript, enhancing development efficiency and reducing runtime errors.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool used for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.
- **Node.js**: Used as the runtime environment to execute JavaScript on the server side.
- **Custom Domain**: Managed through Vercel for a professional domain presence.
- **astro-nano**: A minimalistic theme by [markhorn-dev](https://github.com/markhorn-dev) used as the base for the site design.
