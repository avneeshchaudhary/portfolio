> **Key Takeaway:** Identify your drone's requirements early on—its load capacity, flight range, and data collection capabilities.

## System Design and Integration

We used the Pixhawk 4 Mini flight controller as the central hub for communication with GPS and sensors like LiDAR and ultrasonic for real-time obstacle detection. Each motor is connected to a 30A electronic speed controller (ESC), linked back to the power distribution board for effective power management across all systems.

> **Key Takeaway:** Precise placement and connectivity of components are crucial and often require several iterations to perfect.

## Testing and Optimization

Our initial tests, aimed to be straightforward, presented unexpected challenges. Here’s an overview of our testing activities and the issues we faced:

| Testing Activity                 | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Motor Performance Testing        | Extensive testing at various thrust levels, with performance analytics. |
| Motion Orientation Configuration | Setup verified in flight software for stability.                        |
| ESC Recalibration                | Adjusted ESCs for optimal communication with the flight controller.     |
| Weight Monitoring                | Ensured optimal drone weight for performance efficiency.                |
| Propeller Matching               | Confirmed proper configurations for balanced dynamics.                  |

Challenges Encountered:
- **Battery Issues**: Multiple "bad battery" warnings led to a review of our battery management systems.

>**Key Takeaway:** Continuous testing and adjustments are vital. Real-world conditions teach resilience and adaptability.

## Team Collaboration

Collaborating with a diverse team of experts was a key highlight of this project. Everyone’s unique skills contributed significantly, making the drone more than just a machine.
